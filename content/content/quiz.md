## Question 1

When you perform an operation on one particle, how long does it take for the other entangled particle to be affected?

A: Instantaneously  
B: 1 Nanosecond  
C: 1 Microsecond  
D: As long as the time light takes to travel between their positions  

{{< details title="Answer" open=false >}}
**Answer: A**

The collapse of the state of the other entangled particle happens at the exact same time we perform an operation on its entangled particle.

## Question 2

What is the assumption that the EPR paradox is trying to counter?

A: Light is a wave  
B: Light is a particle  
C: One cannot measure a physical quantity more accurately than a certain constant value  
D: A physical quantity of a system does not have a definite value until a measurement of said quantity takes place  

{{< details title="Answer" open=false >}}
**Answer: D**

The EPR Paradox is a thought experiment which showed that if we measure a certain physical quantity in one system, we will know for sure the corresponding quantity in a system that is entangled to the initial one.

## Question 3

In the CHSH game, what is the expectation of the win rate for the best possible classical strategy?

A: 100% (there exists a perfect strategy)  
B: 85%  
C: 75%  
D: 50%

## Question 5

What is the maximum number of particles that can be entangled with each other?

A: 1  
B: 2  
C: 3  
D: There is no limit.  
{{< details title="Answer" open=false >}}
**Answer: D**

Theoretically, there is no such limit for the number of particles that can be entangled with each other. In fact, [Kong et. al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-15899-1) were able to produce **at least 15.2 quadrillion** entangled atoms.

Do note as well that if the number of entangled particles increases, the degree of entanglement of each particle does decrease. This is known as the [Coffman-Kundu-Wootters monogamy](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.61.052306).
