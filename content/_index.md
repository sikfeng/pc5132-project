Have you ever wondered why toasters’ heating elements glow red, of all the colors? Or why old school light bulbs’ heating elements turn white when heated? All of that can be explained by quantum theory! To understand quantum physics, it would be inevitable that you will encounter something called quantum entanglement.

This website will provide a general qualitative understanding of quantum entanglement. We will cover the definition of quantum entanglement, the applications of quantum entanglement, the EPR paradox and the Bell’s inequality.

This website is intended for students studying in Junior college. However, we welcome anyone with a passion for physics to learn more about quantum entanglement!
