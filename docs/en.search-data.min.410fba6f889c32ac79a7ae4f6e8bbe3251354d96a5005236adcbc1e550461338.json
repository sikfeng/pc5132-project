Niels Bohr, who supported the theory, reportedly told Einstein to \u0026ldquo;stop telling God what to do\u0026rdquo;. The debate between Einstein and Bohr continued for about 8 years, before Einstein formulated his best argument against Bohr’s theory: the EPR (Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen) paradox. Quantum entanglement was first discussed in this paradox, though the three scientists did not coin the term quantum entanglement. Shortly after, Erwin Schrödinger recognized the importance of the EPR paradox, and gave it the name \u0026ldquo;Verschränkung\u0026rdquo;, which translated by himself as \u0026ldquo;entanglement\u0026rdquo;. The EPR paradox sparked interest among the physicists at that time. However, it was until 1964 before the inconsistencies of the EPR paradox was found by John Stewart Bell. He then formulated his famous inequality: Bell’s inequality, which carried the analysis of quantum entanglement much further.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/content/preliminaries/","title":"Preliminaries","section":"Content","content":"Preliminaries #  Before we start, we would like to introduce a few concepts that will be needed later.\nUncertainty Principle #  I am sure that your physics teachers have taught you this: when conducting physics experiments, the measurements you make must be accompanied by an “uncertainty”. Your teacher may have told you that this “uncertainty” value is due to the accuracy of the measuring instrument, as well as human error. Hence, many people would assume that the uncertainty principle is about something of similar nature. However, that is a misconception. The uncertainty principle is actually one of the fundamental principles that describes how our universe works. It is about how one cannot accurately measure both velocity and position of a certain object. This is derived from the wave-particle duality of everything in the universe. A particle’s position can be measured precisely, but not its velocity. In contrast, a wave’s velocity can be precisely measured, but not its position. It sounds pretty cool, doesn’t it?\nWave Functions #  So, we know that particles-or anything in the universe, in that matter-can behave like waves. Now that raises many questions. The first would be: what is the mathematical representation of the wave? And the second would be: what exactly is waving? To answer those questions, the physicists at the time were tasked with two things: 1. Find the wave equation   \\(\\psi(x)\\)  of a particle with wavelength  \\(\\lambda\\)  , and 2. Figure out what exactly is waving in the wave equation. The first question was answered by Erwin Schrodinger with his famous Schrodinger’s Equation (more on that later). However, even Schrodinger himself failed to answer the second question: he assumed that just like water waves (which has the mass density of water waving), the wave of an electron would have the charge density of that electron waving. However, this is proven to be flawed by Max Born later on. Born said that the square of the wave function actually describes that probably of finding the particle of interest (an electron in this case) in a given position. As to the physical interpretation of the wave function, it is still up top debate till this day. At the end of the day, perhaps the physical interpretation is not very important after all.\nComplementarity #  Traditionally, when we talk about complementarity, we are talking about different but non-conflicting descriptions of the same object. For example, you would see a circle when looking top down at a cylinder, but another person would see a rectangle from the side. naturally we would combine the two pictures and have a more descriptive set of information about the aforementioned cylinder. However, we are not able to do this in quantum mechanics. Two sets of information from two separate observers on the same object at the same time can never be combined to give a more detailed observation of the object. A great analogy would be a photograph of two flowers. When you put your focus on flower A, the information about flower B (represented by flurry outlines) will be comprised, and vice versa. This is what complementarity means in quantum mechanics.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/content/dirac-notation/","title":"Dirac Notation","section":"Content","content":"Dirac Notation #  Prerequisite: Basic Linear Algebra (covered under H2 ’A’ Level Further Mathematics Syllabus)\nDirac notation is often used in quantum mechanics and quantum information to describe phenomena.

When performing an operation on one of the particles, the other entangled particles may also be affected by this operation.\nIn Schrödinger\u0026rsquo;s paper, he also highlighted the unintuitiveness of quantum entanglement. He references the 1935 paper by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen3, stating:\n Attention has recently been called to the obvious but very disconcerting fact that even though we restrict the disentangling measurements to one system, the representative obtained for the other system is by no means independent of the particular choice of observations which we select for that purpose and which by the way are entirely arbitrary. It is rather discomforting that the theory should allow a system to be steered or piloted into one or the other type of state at the experimenter’s mercy in spite of his having no access to it.\n Example #  Suppose Bob has 2 electrons which are entangled in the Bell state   \\(|\\psi^\u0026#43;\\rangle=\\frac{\\vert01\\rangle\\otimes\u0026#43;\\vert10\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}\\)  . The electrons are then taken far away from each other. If Bob measures the state of the first electron, it will collapse the wave function of the second electron. In this example, if he measures  \\(\\vert0\\rangle\\)  on the first electron, the second electron will collapse to  \\(\\vert1\\rangle\\)  . Likewise, if he measures  \\(\\vert1\\rangle\\)  on the first electron, the second electron will collapse to  \\(\\vert0\\rangle\\)  . This is an example of the \u0026ldquo;spooky action\u0026rdquo; that Einstein had refered to, where operations on the first election can change the state of the second electron.\nEven though the idea of entanglement had already been introduced by Schrödinger in 1935, it took till 1995 for the first experimental realization of a two-qubit entangling quantum gate by Monroe et al. 4\n  Ryszard Horodecki; Pawel Horodecki; Michal Horodecki; Karol Horodecki (2007). \u0026ldquo;Quantum entanglement\u0026rdquo;. arXiv:quant-ph/0702225\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Schrödinger, E.

It was to counter an assumption in quantum physics. Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg said that a quantum particle or system does not have a definite value until a measurement takes place.\nHowever, if we could predict with certainty the value of a physical quantity without in any way disturbing a system, then there exists an already given value corresponding to that quantity. From this, they inferred that the second particle must have a definite position and/or momentum prior to either being measured.\n Credit: Photograph by Orren Jack Turner, Princeton, N.J\n    Credit: Emilio Segrè Visual Archives\n    Credit: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\n    The paper published by physicists Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen (EPR)1, describes what happens to 2 systems that are allowed to interact. After a while, the systems will move away from each other and assume that there is no more interaction.\nAccording to Heisenberg\u0026rsquo;s uncertainty principle, it is impossible to measure both the momentum and the position of particle B exactly; however, it is possible to measure the exact position of particle A. Therefore, the exact position of particle B can be known. Another way to look at this is that when we measure the momentum of particle A, the exact momentum of particle B can be derived without needing to be measured.\nWe can use this example for other quantities, for example if A and B were a pair of electrons. There will be a 50% chance A has a positive spin. Assume that we measured A to have a positive electron spin. We can then conclude that B has a 100% chance of having a negative electron spin without disturbing B to measure it. If at any point A changes its spin from positive to negative, then B will also change its spin from negative to positive.\nThe examples provided above rebut Bohr’s and Heisenberg’s previous statement.\nBell\u0026rsquo;s Theorem #  In Bell\u0026rsquo;s 1964 paper \u0026ldquo;On the Einstein Podolsky Rosen Paradox\u0026rdquo;2, he described a test that could determine whether quantum physics was incompatible with local hidden variable theories. Bell\u0026rsquo;s theorem can be generalized the CHSH inequality, developed by Clauser et al.3. Experiments have so far all violated this inequality.\nBell\u0026rsquo;s Theorem and its various generalizations also serve as the basis of several applications of quantum entanglement in quantum cryptography, such as the Ekert91 protocol developed by Artur Ekert.4\nCHSH Game #  The CHSH game, named after the CHSH inequality, is a thought experiment that can be physically realizable, hence provides strong evidence against the local hidden variable theories.\nConsider a game with 2 cooperating players, Alice and Bob, and a referee Carol. Alice and Bob are allowed to discuss on a strategy before the game starts, but are not allowed to communicate with each other after it starts. The steps are as follows:\n Carol sends 1 bit   \\(x\\)  to Alice and another bit  \\(y\\)  to Bob. Both of these bits have equal probability of being -1 or 1. Alice and Bob each reply Carol with their own bits  \\(a\\)  and  \\(b\\)  respectively. Alice and Bob win the round if  \\(x\\cdot y=a\\oplus b\\)  , where  \\(\\oplus\\)  represents the XOR operation.    You can even try this game out with 2 friends! You should soon realize that it is impossible to have a classical strategy that guarantees winning every round. In fact, the best possible strategy will only have an expected win rate of  \\(75\\%\\)  .\nOn the other hand, a quantum stratedy allows for a strategy that can have an expected win rate of  \\(\\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{8}\\right)\\approx85\\%\\)  . The quantum strategy involves Alice and Bob sharing an entangled pair of qubits which are in the state  \\(\\frac{\\vert00\\rangle\u0026#43;\\vert11\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}\\)  . By performing certain measurements at the same time and relpying Carol with a bit that depends on the outcome of this measurement, they are able to attain a higher win probability. This would not be possible if there were non-local hidden variables regarding quantum mechanics.\nProof of win probability of quantum strategy #  The winning probability of the quantum strategy is  \\(\\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{8}\\right)\\)  , which seems like an odd result.

There are a few applications of quantum entanglement quantum cryptography, extremely precise clocks, quantum computers and improved microscopes.\nExtremely precise clocks #  Look at your watch, and the time on your computer or phone. Chances are they may not display the same time. Even if they do, either you have calibrated your watch to prevent having too big an error or your watch requires a change of battery. This error can be the watch being faster or slower by a few minutes.\nIn recent years, there have been more resources allocated to developing extremely precise clocks. Why is this important? In our increasingly digitized world, many aspects of society, such as trading stock or GPS, will need to be accurate and synchronised for maximised profit and for the aid and functionality of driverless cars respectively.\nA new type of clock is being developed called the quantum entanglement atomic clock. It will only be 0.1 seconds out of sync if it started running since the start of the universe. Atoms of ytterbium-171 are stored in close to absolute zero temperatures and trapped in optical captivity. Then a laser will shine at the atoms, causing them to undergo entanglement. A second laser will measure their average frequency, knowing that they can create a clock with absolute minimum error as atoms will remain at the same frequency for long periods.\nQuantum computers #  Quantum computers are faster and able to solve more complex problems than the supercomputers of today. Ever since the introduction of computers, the processing units have become smaller and more efficient. Computers that took up a whole desk 30 years ago are less powerful than the phones in the palm of our hands. However, we are reaching the processing limits to these physical chips. The smallest units of information for supercomputers are bits, whereas quantum computers use qubits as smallest units of information. These qubits can be an electron spin or an electron charge or photons. (anything that is at least a 2-level quantum-mechanical system). Supercomputers, using 4 bits can store 1 of 16 different values. However, due to superposition where the value of the qubit is not known until measured, 4 qubits can store 16 different values. Using quantum entanglement, as each qubit is linked, every qubit added will double the number of values it can store. The qubits can react to a change in the value of other qubits regardless of how far they are apart, thus this allows them to store the 16 different values. More calculations can be run at once and in parallel. While the average person does not require the strength of quantum computing, this technology can be used for solving more complex problems and optimising the shipping routes in global supply chains.\nQuantum cryptography #  Watch the following video1 for a visual explanation to the BB84 protocol, one of the first and simplest quantum key distribution protocols!\n    Physics Girl (2016). \u0026ldquo;Quantum Cryptography Explained\u0026rdquo;.
